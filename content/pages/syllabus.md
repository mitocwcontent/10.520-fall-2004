Overview
--------

Key aspects of chemical engineering involve the use and manipulation of intermolecular interactions in the liquid and solid state. This course provides an introduction to these concepts of molecular design and self assembly from a chemical perspective. The basic principles of covalent and ionic bonding, intermolecular interactions, and hydrogen bonding, and the roles of these forces in the final properties of liquids and solids will be discussed. This course emphasizes the ability to control and manipulate familiar macroscopic properties of chemical systems by molecularly engineering the "active" components. Emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the nature of chemical and intermolecular forces and the ability to molecularly design new materials systems based on the required property, ease of synthesis, and typical engineering constraints (cost, environmental factors, etc.). Discussions of the interplay between molecular structure and properties such as crystallization, (bio)adhesion, and friction provide examples of the paradigms of molecular design. The application of this understanding to chemical engineering problems in areas such as biomaterials, nanostructured organic materials, electro-optical materials, colloids, and surface science will be discussed.

Course targets seniors and 1st/2nd year graduate students.
